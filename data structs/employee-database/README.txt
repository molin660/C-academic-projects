# employee database records
An academic project writted in C, completed during 
Intermediate Programming with Professor Ritu Charturdevi.

# Learning Outcomes 
This assignment employed linked list data structures to dynamically 
manipulate datasets relating to employee records. 
Dynamic memory management, data structures and algorithms, 
and File I/O were the focus of this project.

using pointers, I implemented linked list data structures 

# Functionality 
Functions include hiring (appending node values), 
firing (removing node values), and searching (traversing DSA).
