# DNA Sequencing 
This assignment applied the fundamental syntax of C and general datatypes found in most langauges.

# Learning outcomes
Topics explored include: strings, loops, conditional statements, functions, array indexing, boolean logic

# Reflection 

Although I was not unfamiliar with these primitive datatypes, getting used to C syntax is new and 
taught me a lot about reprogramming your mind to fit the various languages out there. 

I am very interested in bioinformatics so this was a nice interdisciplinary application of coding and genetics
